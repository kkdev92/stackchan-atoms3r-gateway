# Kkdev92.StackChan.Gateway.Diagnostics

Fixed responses, for bringing a device up without any model.

Replaces speech-to-text, the agent, and text-to-speech with fixed responses that
need no external service. You can exercise **only the link to the device**,
without standing up a model or a recognizer.

```csharp
services.AddStackChanOfflineFixtures(configuration);
```

This package is intended for the first connection check after wiring a device and for wire
regression tests. It does not provide conversational responses.

## Where this package sits

StackChan Gateway SDK provides building blocks for a gateway that converses
with an AtomS3R stack-chan. Applications select the speech recognizer, model,
capabilities, and other behavior.
